sdesc: "Quilt for git; similar to Mercurial queues"
ldesc: "Application (Git Quilt) includes series of bash scripts which add a
Mercurial queues-like functionality and interface to git. The one
distinguishing feature from other quilt-like porcelains, is the format
of the patches directory. _All_ the information is stored as plain
text - a series file and the patches (one per file). This easily lends
itself to versioning the patches using any number of of SCMs."
